<h2>A tour of the Linux VFS</h2>

<blockquote><i>
I'm not an expert on this topic.  I've never written a filesystem
from scratch; I've only worked on the proc filesystem, and I didn't
do much real filesystem hacking there, only extensions to what was
already there.

<p>So if you see any mistakes or ommissions here (there have
<b>got</b> to be ommissions in a piece this short on a topic
this large), please respond, in order to let me fix them and
let other people know about them.
</i></blockquote>

<p>In Linux, all files are accessed through the Virtual
Filesystem Switch, or VFS. This is a layer of code which
implements generic filesystem actions and vectors requests to
the correct specific code to handle the request.  Two main
types of code modules take advantage of the VFS services,
device drivers and filesystems. Because device drivers are
covered elsewhere in the KHG, we won't cover them explicitly here.
This tour will focus on filesystems.  Because the VFS doesn't
exist in a vacuum, we'll show its relationship with the
favorite Linux filesystem, the ext2 filesystem.

<p>One warning: without a decent understanding of the system
calls that have to do with files, you are not likely to be able
to make heads or tails of filesystems.  Most of the VFS and
most of the code in a normal Linux filesystem is pretty
directly related to completing normal system calls, and you
will not be able to understand how the rest of the system works
without understanding the system calls on which it is based.

<h3>Where to find the code</h3>

<p>The source code for the VFS is in the fs/ subdirectory of the
Linux kernel source, along with a few other related pieces, such
as the buffer cache and code to deal with each executable file
format. Each specific filesystem is kept in a
lower subdirectory; for example, the ext2 filesystem source code
is kept in fs/ext2/.

<p>This table gives the names of the files in the fs/
subdirectory and explains the basic purpose of each one. The
middle column, labeled <b>system</b>, is supposed to show to
which major subsystem the file is (mainly) dedicated. EXE means
that it is used for recognizing and loading executable files.
DEV means that is for device driver support. BUF means buffer
cache. VFS means that it is a part of the VFS, and delegates
some functionality to filesystem-specific code. VFSg means that
this code is completely generic and never delegates part of its
operation to specific filesystem code (that I noticed, anyway)
and which you shouldn't have to worry about while writing a
filesystem.

<h3>Attaching a filesystem to the kernel</h3>

<p>If you look at the code in any filesystem for
<tt>init_<i>name</i>_fs()</tt>, you will find that it
probably contains about one line of code.  For instance, in the ext2fs,
it looks like this (from fs/ext2/super.c):
<pre>
   int init_ext2_fs(void)
   {
           return register_filesystem(&amp;ext2_fs_type);
   }
</pre>
All it does is register the filesystem with the registry kept
in fs/super.c. <tt>ext2_fs_type</tt> is a pretty simple structure:
<pre>
   static struct file_system_type ext2_fs_type = {
           ext2_read_super, "ext2", 1, NULL
   };
</pre>
The <tt>ext2_read_super</tt> entry is a pointer to a function
which allows a filesystem to be mounted (among other things;
more later). <tt>"ext2"</tt> is the name of the filesystem
type, which is used (when you type <tt>mount ... -t ext2</tt>)
to determine which filesystem to use to mount a device. The
<tt>1</tt> says that it needs a device to be mounted on (unlike
the proc filesyste or a network filesystem), and the
<tt>NULL</tt> is required to fill up space that will be used to
keep a linked list of filesystem types in the filesystem
registry, kept in (look it up in the table!) fs/super.c.

<p>It's possible for a filesystem to support more than one
type of filesystem.  For instance, in fs/sysv/inode.c, three
possible filesystem types are supported by one filesystem,
with this code:
<pre>
   static struct file_system_type sysv_fs_type[3] = {
           {sysv_read_super, "xenix", 1, NULL},
           {sysv_read_super, "sysv", 1, NULL},
           {sysv_read_super, "coherent", 1, NULL}
   };

   int init_sysv_fs(void)
   {
           int i;
           int ouch;
   
           for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
                   if ((ouch = register_filesystem(&sysv_fs_type[i])) != 0)
                           return ouch;
           }
           return ouch;
   }
</pre>

<h3>Connecting the filesystem to a disk</h3>

<p>The rest of the communication between the filesystem code
and the kernel doesn't happen until a device bearing that type
of file system is mounted. When you mount a device containing
an ext2 file system, <tt>ext2_read_super()</tt> is called. If
it succeeds in reading the superblock and is able to mount the
filesystem, it fills in the <tt>super_block</tt> structure with
information that includes a pointer to a structure called
<tt>super_operations</tt>, which contains pointers to functions
which do common operations related to superblocks; in this
case, pointers to functions specific to ext2.

<p>A superblock is the block that defines an entire filesystem
on a device. It is sometimes mythical, as in the case of the
DOS filesystem--that is, the filesystem may or may not actually
have a block on disk that is the real superblock.  If not, it
has to make something up.  Operations that pertain to the
filesystem as a whole (as opposed to individual files) are
considered superblock operations. The <tt>super_operations</tt>
structure contains pointers to functions which manipulate
inodes, the superblock, and which refer to or change the status
of the filesystem as a whole (<tt>statfs()</tt> and
<tt>remount()</tt>).

<p>You have probably noticed that there are a lot of pointers,
and especially pointers to functions, here. The good news is
that all the messy pointer work is done; that's the VFS's job.
All the author for the filesystem needs to do is fill in
(usually static) structures with pointers to functions, and
pass pointers to those structures back to the VFS so it can get
at the filesystem and the files.

<p>For example, the super_operations structure looks like
this (from <tt>&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</tt>):
<pre>
   struct super_operations {
           void (*read_inode) (struct inode *);
           int (*notify_change) (struct inode *, struct iattr *);
           void (*write_inode) (struct inode *);
           void (*put_inode) (struct inode *);
           void (*put_super) (struct super_block *);
           void (*write_super) (struct super_block *);
           void (*statfs) (struct super_block *, struct statfs *, int);
           int (*remount_fs) (struct super_block *, int *, char *);
   };
</pre>
That's the VFS part.  Here's the much simpler declaration of
the ext2 instance of that structure, in fs/ext2/super.c:
<pre>
   static struct super_operations ext2_sops = {
           ext2_read_inode,
           NULL,
           ext2_write_inode,
           ext2_put_inode,
           ext2_put_super,
           ext2_write_super,
           ext2_statfs,
           ext2_remount
   };
</pre>
First, notice that an unneeded entry has simply been set to
<tt>NULL</tt>. That's pretty normal Linux behavior; whenever
there is a sensible default behavior of a function pointer,
and that sensible default is what you want, you are almost
sure to be able to provide a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer and get
the default painlessly. Second, notice how simple and clean
the declaration is. All the painful stuff like
<tt>sb-&gt;s_op-&gt;write_super(sb);</tt>
s hidden in the VFS implementation.

<p>The details of how the filesystem actually reads and writes
the blocks, including the superblock, from and to the disk will
be covered in a different section.  There will actually be (I hope)
two descriptions--a simple, functional one in a section on how
to write filesystems, and a more detailed one in a tour through
the buffer cache.
For now, assume that it is done by magic...
<!--FIXME-->

<h3>Mounting a filesystem</h3>

<p>When a filesystem is mounted (which file is in charge of
mounting a filesystem?  Look at the table above, and find that
it is fs/super.c.  You might want to follow along in
fs/super.c), <tt>do_umount()</tt> calls read_super, which ends
up calling (in the case of the ext2 filesystem),
<tt>ext2_read_super()</tt>, which returns the superblock. That
superblock includes a pointer to that structure of pointers to
functions that we see in the definition of <tt>ext2_sops</tt>
above. It also includes a lot of other data; you can look at
the definition of <tt>struct super_block</tt> in
include/linux/fs.h if you like.

<h3>Finding a file</h3>

<p>Once a filesystem is mounted, it is possible to access files
on that filesystem.  There are two main steps here: looking up
the name to find what inode it points to, and then accessing
the inode.

<p>When the VFS is looking at a name, it includes a path.
Unless the filename is absolute (it starts with a <tt>/</tt>
character), it is relative to the current directory of the
process that made the system call that included a path. It uses
filesystem-specific code to look up files on the filesystems
specified. It takes the path name one component (filename
components are separated with <tt>/</tt> characters) at a time,
and looks it up. If it is a directory, then the next component
is looked up in the directory returned by the previous lookup.
Every component which is looked up, whether it is a file or a
directory, returns an <b>inode number</b> which uniquely
identifies it, and by which its contents are accessed.

<p>If the file turns out to be a symbolic link to another file,
then the VFS starts over with the new name which is retrieved
from the symbolic link.  In order to prevent infinite
recursion, there's a limit on the <b>depth</b> of symlinks; the
kernel will only follow so many symlinks in a row before giving
up.

<p>When the VFS and the filesystem together have resolved a
name into an inode number (that's the <tt>namei()</tt> function
in namei.c), then the inode can be accessed. The
<tt>iget()</tt> function finds <b>and returns</b> the inode
specified by an inode number. The <tt>iput()</tt> function is
later used to release access to the inode. It is kind of like
<tt>malloc()</tt> and <tt>free()</tt>, except that more than
one process may hold an inode open at once, and a reference
count is maintained to know when it's free and when it's not.

<p>The integer file handle which is passed back to the
application code is an offset into a file table for that
process. That file table slot holds the inode number that was
looked up with the <tt>namei()</tt> function until the file is
closed or the process terminates. So whenever a process does
anything to a ``file'' using a file handle, it is really
manipulating the inode in question.

<h3>inode Operations</h3>

<p>That inode number and <tt>inode</tt> structure have to come
from somewhere, and the VFS can't make them up on it's own.
They have to come from the filesystem. So how does the VFS look
up the name in the filesystem and get an <tt>inode</tt> back?

<p>It starts at the beginning of the path name and looks up the
inode of the first directory in the path.  Then it uses that
inode to look up the next directory in the path.  When it
reachs the end, it has found the inode of the file or directory
it is trying to look up.  But since it needs an <tt>inode</tt>
to get started, how <b>does</b> it get started with the first
lookup?  There is an inode pointer kept in the superblock
called <tt>s_mounted</tt> which points at an inode structure
for the filesystem.  This inode is allocated when the
filesystem is mounted and de-allocated when the filesystem is
unmounted.  Normally, as in the ext2 filesystem, the
<tt>s_mounted</tt> inode is the inode of the root directory of
the filesystem.  From there, all the other inodes can be looked
up.

<p>Each inode includes a pointer to a structure of pointers to
functions.  Sound familiar?  This is the
<tt>inode_operations</tt> structure.  One of the elements of
that structure is called <tt>lookup()</tt>, and it is used to
look up another inode on the same filesystem.  In general,
a filesystem has only one <tt>lookup()</tt> function that
is the same in every inode on the filesystem, but it is
possible to have several different <tt>lookup()</tt> functions
and assign them as appropriate for the filesystem; the proc
filesystem does this because different directories in the
proc filesystem have different purposes.

The <tt>inode_operations</tt> structure looks like this (defined,
like most everything we are looking at, in <tt>&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</tt>):
<pre>
   struct inode_operations {
           struct file_operations * default_file_ops;
           int (*create) (struct inode *,const char *,int,int,struct inode **);
           int (*lookup) (struct inode *,const char *,int,struct inode **);
           int (*link) (struct inode *,struct inode *,const char *,int);
           int (*unlink) (struct inode *,const char *,int);
           int (*symlink) (struct inode *,const char *,int,const char *);
           int (*mkdir) (struct inode *,const char *,int,int);
           int (*rmdir) (struct inode *,const char *,int);
           int (*mknod) (struct inode *,const char *,int,int,int);
           int (*rename) (struct inode *,const char *,int,struct inode *,const char *,int);
           int (*readlink) (struct inode *,char *,int);
           int (*follow_link) (struct inode *,struct inode *,int,int,struct inode **);
           int (*readpage) (struct inode *, struct page *);
           int (*writepage) (struct inode *, struct page *);
           int (*bmap) (struct inode *,int);
           void (*truncate) (struct inode *);
           int (*permission) (struct inode *, int);
           int (*smap) (struct inode *,int);
   };
</pre>

<p>Most of these functions map directly to system calls.

<p>In the ext2 filesystem, directories, files, and symlinks
have different <tt>inode_operations</tt> (this is normal). The
file fs/ext2/dir.c contains <tt>ext2_dir_inode_operations</tt>,
the file fs/ext2/file.c contains
<tt>ext2_file_inode_operations</tt>, and the file
fs/ext2/symlink.c contains
<tt>ext2_symlink_inode_operations</tt>.

<p>There are many system calls related to files (and
directories) which aren't accounted for in the
<tt>inode_operations</tt> structure; those are found in the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure.  The
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure is the same one used when
writing device drivers
and contains operations that work specifically on files, rather
than inodes:
<pre>
   struct file_operations {
           int (*lseek) (struct inode *, struct file *, off_t, int);
           int (*read) (struct inode *, struct file *, char *, int);
           int (*write) (struct inode *, struct file *, const char *, int);
           int (*readdir) (struct inode *, struct file *, void *, filldir_t);
           int (*select) (struct inode *, struct file *, int, select_table *);
           int (*ioctl) (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);
           int (*mmap) (struct inode *, struct file *, struct vm_area_struct *);
           int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);
           void (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
           int (*fsync) (struct inode *, struct file *);
           int (*fasync) (struct inode *, struct file *, int);
           int (*check_media_change) (kdev_t dev);
           int (*revalidate) (kdev_t dev);
   };
</pre>
There are also a few functions which aren't directly related to
system calls--and where they don't apply, they can simply be set
to <tt>NULL</tt>.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The role of the VFS is:
<ul>
<li>Keep track of available filesystem types.
<li>Associate (and disassociate) devices with instances of the
appropriate filesystem.
<li>Do any reasonable generic processing for operations involving
files.
<li>When filesystem-specific operations become necessary, vector
them to the filesystem in charge of the file, directory, or inode in
question.
</ul>
The interaction between the VFS and specific filesystem types
occurs through two main data structures, the <tt>super_block</tt>
structure and the <tt>inode</tt> structure, and their associated
data structures, including <tt>super_operations</tt>,
<tt>inode_operations</tt>, <tt>file_operations</tt>, and others,
which are kept in the include file <tt>&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</tt>.

<p>Therefore, the role of a specific filesystem code is to
provide a superblock for each filesystem mounted and a unique
inode for each file on the filesystem, and to provide code to
carry out actions specific to filesystems and files that are
requested by system calls and sorted out by the VFS.
